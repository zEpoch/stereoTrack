# Introduction

Trajectory inference (TI) provides important insights in understanding cell development and biological process. However, the integration of transcriptomic profiles and spatial locations to organize spatiotemporal cell orders is currently remaining challenges. Here we introduce spaTrack, which effectively constructs cell trajectories from an optimal-transport matrix at single cell resolution, taking into account both profile of gene expression and distance cost of cell transition in a spatial context. 

stereoTrack has the potential to capture fine local details of trajectory within a single tissue section of 3D spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, as well as reconstruct cell dynamics across multiple tissue sections in a time series. To capture potential dynamic drivers, spaTrack models the fate of a cell as a function of expression profile along the time points driven by transcription factors, which facilitates the identification of key molecular regulators that govern cellular trajectories.
